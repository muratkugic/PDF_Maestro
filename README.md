Blazor WebApp that populates AcfroForm Fields and presents it to user

The app fetches data from the swapi api. I then populates the fields on the index page.
When you press the Generate PDF button:
- the data from the form is being saved to the DB
- a new tab is opened
- the data that has been saved is being loaded onInitialized
- the pdf form is filled in according to the appropriate values are being assigned
- PDF is loaded in hte new tab for user to check and save/share

I wanted to show what I learned the past week with a short sample app.
I dit not but could/should have put more time into error handling, logging etc. 
The aim of this app is to show how I solved an issue at my LIA (LÃ¤rande i Arbete).
